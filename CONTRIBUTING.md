## 📢 Conventional Commits 📢

To enhance our development workflow, enable automated changelog
generation, and pave the way for Continuous Delivery, the `lootparcels-foundryvtt`
project has adopted the [Conventional Commits standard](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)
for all commit messages.

Going forward, all commits to this repository **MUST** adhere to the
Conventional Commits standard. Commits not adhering to this standard
will cause the CI build to fail. PRs will not be merged if they include
non-conventional commits.

A git pre-commit hook may be installed to validate your conventional
commit messages before pushing them to GitHub by running `bin/setup` in
the project root.

[Commit Message Guidelines section of
CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md#commit-message-guidelines)
